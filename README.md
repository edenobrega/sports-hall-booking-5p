## UX
As the site revolves around a single purpose I chose to keep the UX simple and have multiple ways to this main purpose,(which is booking a sports facility) at a time, so that the user is always able to get to the search page.

For the actual booking page, I will be using a calendar and a table, from which the user will select a date from the calendar and the table will be updated to display a list times. This will be an easy to understand and use system, while also being easy to display on both mobile and desktop devices.

All admin/owner pages will be table layouts as they will be mainly just displaying data and this will be the easiest and most concise way to display such data.

### Color Scheme
I will be using only two colors for the site, Blue, #1d71b8 and Green, #44ad47. 

### Typography
Gill Sans. I do not feel multiple are needed for a simple site.
